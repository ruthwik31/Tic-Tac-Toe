If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.
<br>
The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘0’ and draws it on 
any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘1’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘0’ and ‘1’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all grids are filled.</p>
